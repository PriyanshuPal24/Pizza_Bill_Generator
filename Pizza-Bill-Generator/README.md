# Pizza Bill Generator

This project is a simple **Pizza Bill Generator** built entirely with **Core Java** and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts. It allows users to customize their pizza by choosing between Veg or Meat pizza, adding extra cheese, extra toppings, and opting for takeaway. It calculates the total price and generates the bill accordingly.

## Features

-   Choose between **Veg** or **Meat** pizza.
-   Option to select a **large size** for the pizza.
-   Add **extra cheese** and **extra toppings**.
-   Opt for **takeaway packaging**.
-   **Generate a detailed bill** that includes all selections.

## Topics Used

-   **Core Java** concepts:
    
    -   **Switch-case structure**: To handle user actions like adding extra cheese, toppings, opting for takeaway, and generating the bill.
    -   **Basic I/O**: Using `Scanner` for user inputs.
    -   **Conditional Statements**: To check if extra items have been added or takeaway is selected.
    -   **StringBuilder**: For efficient bill generation.
-   **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**:
    
    -   **Classes and Objects**: `Pizza` class to represent the pizza, with different methods to modify its attributes.
    -   **Encapsulation**: Pizza properties (e.g., price, isVeg, isLarge) are encapsulated using private fields and accessed/modified through public methods.
    -   **Constructors**: To initialize pizza type (Veg or Meat) and size (large or not).
    -   **Methods**: For adding extras (cheese, toppings, takeaway) and generating the bill.


## Technologies Used
- **IDE**: Apache NetBeans IDE 22.
-   **Java**: Version 8 and higher.
-   **Core Java** and **OOP Principles**.
